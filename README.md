# Robot Arm Manipulator Environment

ROS packages for training my 6-axis robot arm (open-source hardware design by tw2ka) for reinforcement learning tasks.

Using ROS2 Jazzy and Gazebo Harmonic.

### TODO:
- fix gazebo launch file
- inverse kinematics for end effector manipulation
- add objects for manipulation
- add camera sensor
